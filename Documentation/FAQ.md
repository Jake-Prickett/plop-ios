## FAQ 

### Why is it called PLOP?

Because it sounds funny to say, the acronym sort of works, and the developer who created it has the sense of humor of a 4 year old.

### How do I access the debug panel?

You are given two options, either directly presenting `PLOP` on tap of a button only visible in `DEBUG` builds... or the preferred (much more fun) is to enable the Shake Gesture feature and Shake it like a polaroid picture. ðŸ‘‹  (Shake your phone or hit CMD+CTLR+Z on the simulator)

### Can I modify/extend the PLOP framework?

Yeah, if the debug panel's current functionality isn't enough feel free to open a pull request. 

### Is it possible for this to show up in a production app?

No, as long as all debug panel code is wrapped in `DEBUG` preprocessor flags, you should be good to go! ðŸš¢ it!

### Is okay to do something hacky in the debug panel? 

Of course, for the most part the debug panel is an internal sandbox for developers to place code not ready for production. So feel free to go crazy. 

### Do you have any GIFs of Jean Claude Van Damme dancing? 

Yeah totally, here you go...
