## Elevator Pitch 

Programmable Live Objects Panel, PLOP for short, is a hidden screen in your app that can be leveraged to make Development and Testing easier both on Xcode Simulator and iOS Devices. This is done by adding various components that interact with code that isn't quite Production ready or Development specific needs that boost productivity. The PLOP Panel is only present during `DEBUG` builds, making it the perfect Developer tool!

## Features üéÅ

* Hidden Developer Screen
* Ability to add tools/features to develop faster
* Pre-Built Components to easily allow for common interactions

## Example Use Cases üì±

* Enable/Disable Feature Flags üö©
* Shortcut to a feature or screen you are working on
* Location simulation (on device or simulator)
* Configuring Test Data
* Clearing settings/preferences
* Switching between environments (Dev, Prod, etc.)
* Debug Logging

And many more! ü§ì The possibilities are limitless.

## Basic Usage
The Debug Panel is a hidden screen in an app that can be accessed via a defined entry point (Button only visible in `DEBUG` builds) or the shake gesture (CMD+CTRL+Z on Simulator).

Within the debug panel you can add functionality and hook up code that is not ready for production. 

> Note: The debug panel is only accessible when the DEBUG preprocessor flag is set to 1

---

Much of your setup can be done in your `AppDelegate.swift` you can have your setup code similar to below:

```swift
    ...
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        #if DEBUG
	setupPLOPComponents() // Where you add sections, components, switches, etc.
	PLOP.enableShakeToLaunchPanel() // Enables Shake gesture presentation
	#endif
        return true
    }
    ...
```

Or, if you'd rather have the panel be presented on tap of a button:

```swift
   class ViewController: UIViewController {

      override func viewDidLoad() {
          super.viewDidLoad()

          let button = UIButton(type: .system)
          button.setTitle("Show Panel", for: .normal)
          button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(togglePLOP), for: .touchUpInside)

          ... 

          configurePLOP()
      }

      private func configurePLOP() {
          /*
    	     Where you add sections, components, switches, etc.
  	   */

          PLOP.reloadPanel()
      }

      @objc func togglePLOP() {
          PLOP.showPanel()
      }
   }  
```

> Note: Ensure that the button is only visible in `DEBUG` builds, otherwise you could have some issues where this could be visible in your `RELEASE` Scheme!!

### How to add a Component to PLOP

Button Component
```swift
    let component = ButtonPLOPComponent(title: "Example Component", 
                                        buttonTitle: "Go!", 
                                        action: { _ in /* Execute whatever you want here! */})
```

Switch Component
```swift
    let component = SwitchPLOPComponent(title: "Switch 2", 
                                        action: { component in /* Execute whatever you want here! */ })
```

### How to add a section to PLOP

```swift
    let section = SectionPLOPComponent(
        title: "Feature Flags",
        components: [ /* Insert Components Here */],
        sectionType: .featureFlag
    )
    PLOP.add(section: section)
```
